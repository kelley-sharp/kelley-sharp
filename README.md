### Hello! 👋🏻
I'm a versatile software developer, with several years of experience, a professional computer science degree in addition to my undergraduate BS in nutrition science. I have a diverse background in QA, developer success, front end and full stack roles. I've had a remarkable journey as a first-generation college graduate. I live and work remotely in Maine near Acadia National Park. When I'm not indoors coding, crafting, cooking, or making music, I'm obsessed with getting out on the trails.
